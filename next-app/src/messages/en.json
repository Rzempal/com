        "question": "Robotics and automation engineer in Silesia — who is Michał Rapała?",
        "answer": "A graduate of the **Silesian University of Technology** with over a decade of experience in engineering, **robotics, and industrial automation**. I live and work in Silesia, specializing in **production process simulations**, **industrial robot programming**, and building modern **web applications**."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What is your experience in engineering, robotics, and IT?",
        "answer": "I have over 10 years of professional experience. I specialize in **industrial engineering**, **robotics** and **automation**, as well as the **automotive** industry. In parallel, I develop **websites**, mobile applications, and implement solutions based on **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What was your most demanding project in the automotive industry?",
        "answer": "My key achievement is automating the **body-in-white (BIW)** production process for the **Mercedes G-Class** at the factory in Graz. It was an engineering challenge because this legendary model had been hand-built for the last 40 years. Implementing **robotics and automation** into this process was a milestone for the production line."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Web applications and websites for businesses — Silesia and all of Poland",
        "answer": "Building **web applications** and **websites** for businesses with special focus on the **Silesian market**. From company landing pages to advanced business tools — every project built with a modern stack (**Next.js**, **React**) with emphasis on **performance and scalability**."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Do you optimize websites for SEO?",
        "answer": "Yes, and this section is a perfect example. It's technically tailored for **Google bots**, even though I personally don't enjoy talking about myself — I prefer to let my **completed projects** speak for me."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "What programming technologies do you use in your projects?",
        "answer": "My tech stack focuses on modern, high-performance solutions. For websites and applications, I primarily use **React** and **Next.js**. For mobile apps, I work with **Flutter**. I'm also actively interested in implementing **AI** in code and process automation."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "How do you use artificial intelligence (AI) in your projects?",
        "answer": "**AI** is both a passion and a work tool. I use **artificial intelligence** in engineering projects (**production process optimization**) and in application development — e.g., **Karton-na-leki**, a mobile app for managing a home medicine cabinet with **image recognition**."
